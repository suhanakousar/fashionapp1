## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too Fast** - Slow down, let judges see features
2. **No Narration** - Always explain what you're doing
3. **Poor Audio** - Test microphone, use quiet space
4. **Low Resolution** - Record in at least 1080p
5. **Missing Features** - Show all key features
6. **No Kiro Highlight** - Always show `.kiro` folder
7. **Rushed Ending** - End with clear call-to-action

---

## 📋 Backup Plan

If live demo fails:
1. Have pre-recorded video ready
2. Show static screenshots with narration
