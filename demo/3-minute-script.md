# AUTO-GENERATED BY KIRO
# 3-Minute Demo Script for Fashion Fusion System

## Demo Timeline

### 0:00 - 0:30 | Introduction & Setup
**Script:**
"Welcome to the Fashion Fusion System. This is a complete ML-powered platform that takes fabric images and generates photorealistic mannequin images wearing assembled outfits. Let me show you how it works."

**Actions:**
- Open browser to `/fusion`
- Show the stepper UI (Category → Upload → Options → Generate)
- Highlight the Kiro integration badge

**Key Points:**
- Built with TypeScript/React frontend and Express backend
- Uses open ML models (SAM, ControlNet, Stable Diffusion, Real-ESRGAN)
- Supports multiple garment categories
- Face protection built-in

---

### 0:30 - 1:00 | Category Selection & Fabric Upload
**Script:**
"First, I'll select a garment category - let's choose 'Lehenga'. Now I'll upload fabric images: a top fabric, bottom fabric, and optional trims. The system automatically detects faces and asks for consent if needed."

**Actions:**
1. Click "Lehenga" category
2. Upload fabric images:
   - Top fabric: paisley pattern fabric
   - Bottom fabric: floral pattern fabric
   - Trims: decorative buttons/motif
3. Show face detection notice (if faces detected)
4. Check consent checkbox

**Key Points:**
- Multi-fabric input support
- Face detection with consent flow
- Real-time upload to Cloudinary
- Drag-and-drop interface

---

### 1:00 - 1:30 | Options Configuration
**Script:**
"Now I'll configure the fusion options. I can choose between three modes: silhouette-first preserves the mannequin shape, texture-first prioritizes fabric fidelity, and hybrid balances both. I'll also adjust the strength slider."

**Actions:**
1. Select "Hybrid" mode
2. Adjust strength slider to 0.5
3. Optionally set stitch style and embroidery toggle
4. Click "Create Fusion"

**Key Points:**
- Three generation modes explained
- Strength parameter (0.35-0.7)
- Optional stitch style and embroidery effects

### 1:30 - 2:30 | Generation & Progress
**Script:**
"The system is now processing. It's running through multiple steps: face detection, feature extraction using CLIP, SAM segmentation to locate garment regions, edge extraction for ControlNet, and generating three candidate images - one for each mode."

**Actions:**
1. Show progress bar with step indicators
2. Point out the pipeline steps:
   - Face Detection (10%)
   - Feature Extraction (20%)
   - Segmentation (30%)
   - Edge Extraction (40%)
   - Generating Candidates (70%)
   - Post-Processing (85%)
   - Upscaling (95%)
   - Complete (100%)

**Key Points:**
- Background processing (non-blocking)
- Real-time progress updates
- Three candidates generated (silhouette-first, texture-first, hybrid)
- Uses SAM, ControlNet, Stable Diffusion, Real-ESRGAN

---

### 2:30 - 3:00 | Results & Explainability
**Script:**
"Here are the results! I can see three candidate images. Let me select the best one and show you the explainability panel, which tells us which fabric parts contributed to which regions. I can also try it on the mannequin canvas with drag, zoom, and rotation controls."

**Actions:**
1. Show three candidate thumbnails
2. Click on one to view full size
3. Switch to "Explainability" tab
4. Show contribution regions:
   - "Blouse: paisley pattern (80% contribution)"
   - "Skirt: floral pattern (70% contribution)"
   - "Trims: geometric buttons (50% contribution)"
5. Switch to "Try-On" tab
6. Demonstrate drag, zoom, rotation

**Key Points:**
- Three candidate comparison
- Explainability with fabric source mapping
- Interactive try-on canvas
- Download, share, save to lookbook options

## Key Features to Highlight

1. **Complete ML Pipeline**: SAM, ControlNet, Stable Diffusion, Real-ESRGAN
2. **Face Protection**: Automatic detection with consent flow
3. **Multi-Fabric Support**: Top, bottom, trims, optional reference model
4. **Three Generation Modes**: Silhouette-first, texture-first, hybrid
5. **Explainability**: Shows which fabric parts contributed where
6. **Production Ready**: Mock fallback, error handling, retry logic
7. **Kiro Integration**: .kiro files for spec, steering, hooks, prompts
8. **Training Ready**: LoRA training scripts included

## Troubleshooting Tips

- If APIs fail, system falls back to mock mode
- Face detection may take a few seconds
- Generation takes 30-60 seconds per candidate
- Check browser console for detailed logs

## Judge Mode

- Enable "Judge Test Mode" toggle
- Preloads test images
- Highlights Kiro integration points
- Shows before/after comparisons
